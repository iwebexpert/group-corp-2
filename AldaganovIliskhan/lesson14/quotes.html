            'Waiter': Welcome to our restaurant. Did you book a table in advance?
            'David': Hello. Yes, we ordered a table for Laurins.
            'W': All right. Follow me. Here's your table, as you wanted, by the window. Let me take your and your lady's
            coats.
            'D': Yes, please. Sit down, dear.
            'W': Check out our menu. I'll come in a minute ... Are you ready to order?
            'D': No, not yet. Give us a little time to study the menu.
            'W': Good. Call me when you're ready.
            'D': Darling, what will you eat?
            Amanda: Oh, there is such a chic choice of dishes. I am even confused. What would you advise?
            'D': I can recommend fried duck with cream sauce. A tasty dish. The fish here is also gorgeous. Actually, the chef
            in this restaurant is a true master. All his dishes are delicious.
            'A': Then I'll order a salad with seafood and a duck.
            'D': And the dessert?
            'A': I'd like to try a cheesecake. I love to cook it myself, but I will not refuse from the ready dish.
            'A': Excellent. Waiter!
            'W': I'm listening to you.
            'D': Bring us, please, a salad with seafood and a duck for the lady, and I'll order a julien with mushrooms and
            entrecote.
            'W': Will you order the dessert?
            'D': Yes, of course. One cheesecake and a slice of banana cake.
            'W': What will you drink?
            'D': Today we have a holiday, an anniversary, which means that we will drink champagne.
            'W': Dry, sweet or semisweet?
            'D': White semisweet.
            'W': Excellent choice. Your order will be ready in 15 minutes. Shall I bring the champagne right now?
            'D': Yes, so it will not be boring to wait for our order.
            'W': Here is your champagne. And this is a gift from the chef in honor of your holiday.
            'D': Thank you very much. We are very pleased!
            'A': Your order, sir. Anything else?
            'D': Thank you. All is perfect.
