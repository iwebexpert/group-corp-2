        The American sailors were getting on nicely with the English girls.
        They'd reached the point where they were diving under the water and
        pulling the girls up by their legs. Just then I noticed a small old man
        walking quickly around the edge of the pool. He was beautifully dressed
        in a white suit and a cream-coloured hat, and as he walked he was
        looking at the people and the chairs. He stopped beside me and smiled. I
        smiled back. <br />
        'Excuse me please, but may I sit here?' <br />
        'Certainly,' I said. <br />
        'Go ahead.' <br />
        He inspected the back of the chair for safety, then he sat down and
        crossed his legs. <br />
        'A fine evening,' he said. <br />
        'They are all fine evenings here in Jamaica.' <br />
        I couldn't tell if his accent was Italian or Spanish, but I felt sure he
        was some sort of a South American. He was old, too, when you looked at
        him closely. Probably around sixty-eight or seventy. <br />
        'Yes,' I said. <br />
        'It's wonderful here, isn't it?' <br />
        'And who are all these? These are not hotel people.' He was pointing at
        the bathers in the pool. <br />
        'I think they're American sailors,' I told him. <br />
        'Of course they are Americans. Who else in the world is going to make as
        much noise as that? You are not American, no?' <br />
        'No,' I said. <br />
        'I am not.' Suddenly one of the young sailors was standing in front of
        us. He was still wet from the pool and one of the English girls was
        standing there with him. <br />
        'Are these chairs free?' he said. <br />
        'Yes,' I answered. <br />
        'Mind if I sit down?' <br />
        'Go ahead.' <br />
        'Thanks,' he said. He had a towel in his hand, and when he sat down he
        unrolled it and produced a packet of cigarettes and a lighter. He
        offered the cigarettes to the girl but she refused; then he offered them
        to me and I took one. The old man said, 'Thank you, no, but I think I
        will have a cigar.' He took a cigar out of his pocket, then he produced
        a knife and cut the end off it. <br />
        'Here, let me give you a light.' The American boy held up his lighter.
        <br />
        'That will not work in this wind.' 'Sure it'll work. It always works.'
        <br />
        The old man removed the cigar from his mouth, moved his head to one side
        and looked at the boy. <br />
        'Always?' he said slowly. <br />
        'Sure, it never fails. Not with me anyway.' <br />
        'Well, well. So you say this famous lighter never fails. Is that what
        you say?' <br />
        'Sure,' the boy said. <br />
        'That's right.' He was about nineteen or twenty, with pale skin and a
        rather sharp nose. He was holding the lighter in his hand, ready to turn
        the little wheel. He said, 'I promise you it never fails.' <br />
        'One moment, please.' The hand that held the cigar came up high, as if
        it were stopping traffic. <br />
        'Now just one moment.' He had a curiously soft voice and kept looking at
        the boy all the time. He smiled. <br />
        'Shall we not make a little bet on whether your lighter lights?' <br />
        'Sure, I'll bet,' the boy said. <br />
        'Why not?' <br />
        'You like to bet?' <br />
        'Sure, I'll always bet.'
