            By the half-light of a suspensor lamp, dimmed and hanging near the floor, the awakened boy could see a bulky
            female
            shape at his door, standing one step ahead of his mother. The old woman was a witch shadow - hair like
            matted
            spiderwebs, hooded 'round darkness of features, eyes like glittering jewels.

            'Is he not small for his age, Jessica?' the old woman asked. Her voice wheezed and twanged like an untuned
            baliset.

            Paul's mother answered in her soft contralto: 'The Atreides are known to start late getting their growth,
            Your
            Reverence.'

            'So I've heard, so I've heard.' wheezed the old woman. 'Yet he's already fifteen.'

            'Yes, Your Reverence.'

            'He's awake and listening to us' said the old woman. 'Sly little rascal.' She chuckled. 'But royalty has
            need
            of
            slyness. And if he's really the Kwisatz Haderach…well…'

            Within the shadows of his bed, Paul held his eyes open to mere slits. Two bird-bright ovals —the eyes of the
            old
            woman- seemed to expand and glow as they stared into his.

            'Sleep well, you sly little rascal.' said the old woman. 'Tomorrow you'll need all your faculties to meet my
            gom
            jabbar.'

            And she was gone, pushing his mother out, closing the door with a solid thump.

            Paul lay awake wondering: What's a gom jabbar?
