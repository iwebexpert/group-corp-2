        <p class="text">'Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the Buonapartes. But I warn
            you, if you don't tell me that this means war, if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors
            perpetrated by that Antichrist - I really believe he is Antichrist - I will have nothing more to do with you
            and
            you are no longer my friend, no longer my 'faithful slave' , as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see
            I
            have frightened you—sit down and tell me all the news.' <br>

            It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pávlovna Schérer, maid of honor and favorite
            of the Empress Márya Fëdorovna. With these words she greeted Prince Vasíli Kurágin, a man of high rank and
            importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna Pávlovna had had a cough for some days. She
            was, as she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the
            elite. <br>

            All her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that
            morning, ran as follows: <br>

            'If you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor
            invalid is not too terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10 - Annette
            Schérer.' <br>

            'Heavens! what a virulent attack!' replied the prince, not in the least disconcerted by this reception. He
            had just entered, wearing an embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on his
            breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that refined French in which our grandfathers
            not only spoke but thought, and with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who
            had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna Pávlovna, kissed her hand, presenting to her his
            bald, scented, and shining head, and complacently seated himself on the sofa.<br>

            'First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend's mind at rest,' said he without altering
            his tone, beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be
            discerned. <br>

            'Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling?' said
            Anna Pávlovna. 'You are staying the whole evening, I hope?' <br>

            'And the fete at the English ambassador's? Today is Wednesday. I must put in an appearance there,' said the
            prince. 'My daughter is coming for me to take me there.'

            'I thought today's fete had been canceled. I confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming
            wearisome.' <br>

            'If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been put off,' said the prince, who,
            like a wound-up clock, by force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.<br>

            'Don't tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosíltsev's dispatch? You know everything.' <br>

            'What can one say about it?' replied the prince in a cold, listless tone. 'What has been decided? They have
            decided that Buonaparte has burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.' <br>

            Prince Vasíli always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale part. Anna Pávlovna Schérer on the
            contrary, despite her forty years, overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had
            become her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in
            order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though it did not
            suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed, as in a spoiled child, a continual
            consciousness of her charming defect, which she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to
            correct.</p>
